# New-Meta-Riot-Games-API-Challenge-2.0
A web app which uses Riot Games' API to query the game information and present graphical analysis of thousands of League of Legends matches before and after the 5.13 patch, in which many changes were made to items with the Ability Power stat. The goal of this project is to systematically look for a shift in the "metagame", that is, the most popular (and often most successful) characters played both before and after patch 5.13.
